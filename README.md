# 🧪 Pymaceuticals Tumor Analysis
What’s the point of data if you can’t tell a good story with it? In this project, I analyzed clinical trial data for Pymaceuticals, Inc., a pharmaceutical company researching treatments for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC)—a common form of skin cancer.
## 🔬 Background
As a senior data analyst, I was given access to the company’s latest study, where 249 mice with SCC tumors were treated with different drug regimens over 45 days. My job? Dig into the data, generate meaningful visualizations, and summarize key findings—with a special focus on Pymaceuticals’ drug of interest, Capomulin.
## 📌 What I Did
I tackled this analysis using Pandas and Matplotlib, working through the following steps:
1. Cleaned the dataset: Identified and removed duplicate time points for accurate analysis.
2. Generated summary statistics: Calculated key stats like mean, median, variance, and standard deviation for each drug regimen.
3. Created bar and pie charts: Visualized total data points per drug regimen and the gender distribution of the mice in the study.
4. Identified outliers: Used quartiles and IQR to flag potential outliers in final tumor volumes across four key treatments.
5. Built a box plot: Showed the distribution of final tumor volumes per treatment.
6. Analyzed tumor progression: Created a line plot tracking tumor size over time for a single mouse on Capomulin.
7. Explored weight-tumor relationships: Built a scatter plot and ran a correlation analysis to see how mouse weight impacts tumor volume.
8. Performed linear regression: Overlaid a regression line on the scatter plot to identify trends in tumor reduction.
